This project develops an integrated tool that allows financial analysts to upload PDF URLs, primarily from the SEC website, and receive concise summaries. Furthermore, leverage advanced techniques to build a Q/A system for deep-diving into the document's content.<br>
<br>

Utilizing the strengths of the nougat and pypdf libraries, our platform adeptly pulls content from user-uploaded PDFs. We've seamlessly integrated an advanced Q/A mechanism, taking cues from trusted OpenAI cookbook techniques, to allow analysts to query specific questions and receive concise answers. This holistic solution is presented through an intuitive Streamlit interface, anchored by the solid support of FastAPI and Heroku deployment, ensuring effortless content handling, summarization, and Q&A interactions for users.<br>

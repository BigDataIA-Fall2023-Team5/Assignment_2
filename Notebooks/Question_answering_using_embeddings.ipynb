    "# Question answering using embeddings-based search\n",
    "\n",
    "GPT excels at answering questions, but only on topics it remembers from its training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "What should you do if you want GPT to answer questions about unfamiliar topics? E.g.,\n",
    "- Recent events after Sep 2021\n",
    "- Your non-public documents\n",
    "- Information from past conversations\n",
    "- etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates a two-step Search-Ask method for enabling GPT to answer questions using a library of reference text.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Search:** search your library of text for relevant text sections\n",
    "2. **Ask:** insert the retrieved text sections into a message to GPT and ask it the question"

    "## Why search is better than fine-tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "GPT can learn knowledge in two ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Via model weights (i.e., fine-tune the model on a training set)\n",
    "- Via model inputs (i.e., insert the knowledge into an input message)\n",
    "\n",
    "Although fine-tuning can feel like the more natural option—training on data is how GPT learned all of its other knowledge, after all—we generally do not recommend it as a way to teach the model knowledge. Fine-tuning is better suited to teaching specialized tasks or styles, and is less reliable for factual recall.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an analogy, model weights are like long-term memory. When you fine-tune a model, it's like studying for an exam a week away. When the exam arrives, the model may forget details, or misremember facts it never read.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, message inputs are like short-term memory. When you insert knowledge into a message, it's like taking an exam with open notes. With notes in hand, the model is more likely to arrive at correct answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "One downside of text search relative to fine-tuning is that each model is limited by a maximum amount of text it can read at once:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Model           | Maximum text length       |\n",
    "|-----------------|---------------------------|\n",
    "| `gpt-3.5-turbo` | 4,096 tokens (~5 pages)   |\n",
    "| `gpt-4`         | 8,192 tokens (~10 pages)  |\n",
    "| `gpt-4-32k`     | 32,768 tokens (~40 pages) |\n",
    "\n",
    "Continuing the analogy, you can think of the model like a student who can only look at a few pages of notes at a time, despite potentially having shelves of textbooks to draw upon.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, to build a system capable of drawing upon large quantities of text to answer questions, we recommend using a Search-Ask approach.\n"

    "## Search\n",
    "\n",
    "Text can be searched in many ways. E.g.,\n",
    "\n",
    "- Lexical-based search\n",
    "- Graph-based search\n",
    "- Embedding-based search\n",
    "\n",
    "This example notebook uses embedding-based search. [Embeddings](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings) are simple to implement and work especially well with questions, as questions often don't lexically overlap with their answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider embeddings-only search as a starting point for your own system. Better search systems might combine multiple search methods, along with features like popularity, recency, user history, redundancy with prior search results, click rate data, etc. Q&A retrieval performance may also be improved with techniques like [HyDE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10496), in which questions are first transformed into hypothetical answers before being embedded. Similarly, GPT can also potentially improve search results by automatically transforming questions into sets of keywords or search terms."

    "## Full procedure\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, this notebook demonstrates the following procedure:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Prepare search data (once per document)\n",
    "    1. Collect: We'll download a few hundred Wikipedia articles about the 2022 Olympics\n",
    "    2. Chunk: Documents are split into short, mostly self-contained sections to be embedded\n",
    "    3. Embed: Each section is embedded with the OpenAI API\n",
    "    4. Store: Embeddings are saved (for large datasets, use a vector database)\n",
    "2. Search (once per query)\n",
    "    1. Given a user question, generate an embedding for the query from the OpenAI API\n",
    "    2. Using the embeddings, rank the text sections by relevance to the query\n",
    "3. Ask (once per query)\n",
    "    1. Insert the question and the most relevant sections into a message to GPT\n",
    "    2. Return GPT's answer\n",
    "\n",
    "### Costs\n",
    "\n",
    "Because GPT is more expensive than embeddings search, a system with a decent volume of queries will have its costs dominated by step 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For `gpt-3.5-turbo` using ~1,000 tokens per query, it costs ~$0.002 per query, or ~500 queries per dollar (as of Apr 2023)\n",
    "- For `gpt-4`, again assuming ~1,000 tokens per query, it costs ~$0.03 per query, or ~30 queries per dollar (as of Apr 2023)\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, exact costs will depend on the system specifics and usage patterns."

to arrange to be so accompanied represented or advised You may be represented by counsel who also represents other persons involved in the Commission s investigation This multiple representation however presents a potential conflict of interest if one client s interests are or may be adverse to another s If you are represented by counsel who also represents other persons involved in the investigation the Commission will assume that you and counsel have discussed and resolved all issues concerning possible conflicts of interest The choice of counsel and the responsibility for that choice is yours 3 Transcript Availability Rule 6 of the Commission s Rules Relating to Investigations 17 CFR 203 6 states A person who has submitted documentary evidence or testimony in a formal investigative proceeding shall be entitled upon written request to procure a copy of his documentary evidence or a transcript of his testimony on payment of the appropriate fees Provided however That in a nonpublic formal investigative proceeding the Commission may for good cause deny such request In any event any witness upon proper identification shall have the right to inspect the official transcript of the witness own testimony If you wish to purchase a copy of the transcript of your testimony the reporter will provide you with a copy of the appropriate form Persons requested to supply

administrative civil or criminal proceeding brought by the Commission or any other agency You may refuse in accordance with the rights guaranteed to you by the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States to give any information that may tend to incriminate you If your testimony is not pursuant to subpoena your appearance to testify is voluntary you need not answer any question and you may leave whenever you wish Your cooperation is however appreciated 6 Formal Order Availability If the Commission has issued a formal order of investigation it will be shown to you during your testimony at your request If you desire a copy of the formal order please make your request in writing C Submissions and Settlements Rule 5 c of the Commission s Rules on Informal and Other Procedures 17 CFR 202 5 c states Persons who become involved in investigations may on their own initiative submit a written statement to the Commission setting forth their interests and position in regard to the subject matter of the investigation Upon request the staff in its discretion may advise such persons of the general nature of the investigation including the indicated violations as they pertain to them and the a mount of time that may be available for preparing and submitting a statement prior to the presentation of a staff recommendation to the Commission for the commencement of an administrative or injunction proceeding Submissions by interested persons should be forwarded to the appropriate Division Director or Regional Director with a copy to the staff members conducting the investigation and should be clearly referenced to the specific investigation to which they relate In the event a recommendation for the commencement of an enforcement proceeding is presented by the staff any submissions by interested persons will be forwarded to the Commission in conjunction with the staff memorandum The staff of the Commission routinely seeks to introduce submissions ma de pursuant to Rule 5 c as evidence in Commission enforcement proceedings when the staff deems appropriate Rule 5 f of the Commission s Rules on Informal and Other Procedures 17 CFR 202 5 f states In the course of the Commission s investigations civil lawsuits and administrative proceedings the staff with appropriate authorization may discuss with persons involved the disposition of such matters by consent by settlement or in some other manner It is the policy of the Commission however that the disposition of any such matter may not expressly or impliedly extend to any criminal charges that have been or may be brought against any such person or any recommendation with respect thereto Accordingly any person involved in an enforcement matter before the Commission who consents or agrees to consent to any judgment or order does so solely for the purpose of resolving the claims against him in that investigative civil or administrative matter and not for the purpose of resolving any cri minal charges that have been or might be brought against him This policy reflects the fact that neither the Commission nor its staff has the authority or responsibility for instituting conducting settling or otherwise disposing of criminal proceeding s That authority and responsibility are vested in the Attorney General and representatives of the Department of Justice D Freedom of Information Act The Freedom of Information Act 5 U S C 552 the FOIA generally provides for disclosure of information to the public Rule 83 of the Commission s Rules on Information and Requests 17 CFR 200 83 provides a procedure by which a person can make a written request that information submitted to the Commission not be disclosed under the FOIA That rule states that no determination as to the validity of such a request will be made until a request for disclosure of the information under the FOIA is received Accordingly no response to a request that information not be disclosed under the FOIA is necessary or will be given until a request for disclosure under the FOIA is received If you desire an acknowledgment of receipt of your written request that information not be disclosed under the FOIA please provide a duplicate request together with a stamped self addressed envelope 3 E Authority for Solicitation of Information Persons Directed to Supply Information Pursuant to Subpoena The authority for requiring production of information is set forth in the subpoena Disclosure of the information to the Commiss ion is mandatory subject to the valid assertion of any legal right or privilege you might have Persons Requested to Supply Information Voluntarily One or more of the following provisions authorizes the Commission to solicit the information requested Se ctions 19 and or 20 of the Securities Act of 1933 Section 21 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Section 321 of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 Section 42 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 Section 209 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and 17 CFR 202 5 Disclosure of the requested information to the Commission is voluntary on your part F Effect of Not Supplying Information Persons Directed to Supply Information Pursuant to Subpoena If you fail to comply with the subpoena the Commission may seek a court order requiring you to do so If such an order is obtained and you thereafter fail to supply the information you may be subject to civil and or criminal sanctions for contempt of court In addition Section 21 c of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Section 42 c of the Investment Company Act of 1940 and Section 209 c of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 provide that fines and terms of imprisonment may be imposed upon any person who shall without just cause f ail or refuse to attend and testify or to answer any lawful inquiry or to produce books papers correspondence memoranda and other records in compliance with the subpoena Persons Requested to Supply Information Voluntarily There are no direct sanctions and thus no direct effects for failing to provide all or any part of the requested information G Principal Uses of Information The Commission s principal purpose in soliciting the information is to gather facts in order to determine whether any perso n has violated is violating or is about to violate any provision of the federal securities laws or rules for which the Commission has enforcement authority such as rules of securities exchanges and the rules of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board Facts developed may however constitute violations of other laws or rules Information provided may be used in Commission and other agency enforcement proceedings Unless the Commission or its staff explicitly agrees to the contrary in writing you should not assume that the Commission or its staff acquiesces in accedes to or concurs or agrees with any position condition request reservation of right understanding or any other statement that purports or may be deemed to be or to reflect a li mitation upon the Commission s receipt use disposition transfer or retention in accordance with applicable law of information provided H Routine Uses of Information The Commission often makes its files available to other governmental agencies par ticularly United States Attorneys and state prosecutors There is a likelihood that information supplied by you will be made available to such agencies where appropriate Whether or not the Commission makes its files'"

seq That regulation contains general requirements regarding the preparation and filing of registration statements D Application of Exchange Act Rules 1 If the registrant or any othe r person which is a party to the transaction submits a proposal to its security holders entitled to vote on or consent to the transaction in which the securities being registered are to be issued and that person s submission to its security holders is subject to i Regulation 14A 17 CFR 240 14a 1 through 14a 101 or 14C 17 CFR 240 14c 1 through 14c 101 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Exchange Act or ii the proxy rules under Section 20 of the Investment Company Act 17 CFR 270 20a 1 then the provisions of those regulations shall apply in all respects to the submission except that the prospectus which may be in the form of a proxy or information statement shall contain the information required by this Form in lieu of that required by i Schedule 14A 17 CFR 240 14a 101 or 14C 17 CFR 240 l4c 101 of Regulation 14A or 14C and ii the proxy rules under Section 20 of the Investment Company Act It should be noted however that if a separate proposal subject to those proxy requirements for example with

Preparation of the Registration Statement The following instructions for completing Form N 14 are divided into three parts Part A relates to the prospectus required by Section 10 a of the Securities Act Part B relates to the Statement of Additional Information SAI that must be provided upon request to recipients of the prospectus Part C relates to other information that is required to be in the registration statement 3 Part A The Prospectus The purpose of the prospectus is to provide essential information about the registrant and the transaction in a way that will assist investors in making informed decisions about whether to purchase the securities being offered Because investors who rely on the prospectus may not be sophisticated in legal or financial matters care should be taken that the information in the prospectus is set forth in a clear concise and understandable manner Extensive use of technical or legal terminology or complex language and the inclusion of excessive detail may make the prospectus difficult for many investors to understand and may therefore detract from its usefulness Accordingly registrants should adhere to the following guidelines in responding to the items in Part A l Responses to these items particularly those that call for a brief description should be as simple and direct as possible and should include only information needed to understand the fundamental characteristics of the registrant Brevity is particularly import ant in describing practices or aspects of the registrant s operations that do not differ materially from those of other investment companies 2 Descriptions of practices that are necessitated or otherwise affected by legal requirements should generally not include detailed discussions of the law 3 Responses to those items that use terms such as list or identify should include only a minimum explanation of the matters being listed or identified 4 The so called President s Letter which provides a summary of the proposed transaction may be used as the initial or introductory document to the Part A prospectus Part B Statement of Additional Information Part B of the Registration Statement consists of additional information about the registrant and the company being acquired and certain financial information that the Commission has concluded is not necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors to require in the prospectus if the registrant complies with certain conditions The SAI or information in response to Item 6 of Form N 14 need not be included in the prospectus or accompany it when sent to shareholders provided that 1 the prospectus is sent by first class mail or any other means designed to assure reasonably prompt delivery or given to prospective investors at least 20 business days prior to a the date on which the meeting of security holders is held or b if no meeting is held the earlier of the date of the vote consent or authorization the date the transaction is consummated or the date the securities are purchased or c in the case of an exchange offer subject to the tender offer rules the scheduled expiration date of the offer 2 the cover page of the prospectus or proxy statement in the case of a prospectus in the form of a proxy statement states that the SAI is available upon oral or written request and without charge if the registrant has a toll free telephone number for use by prospective investors that number must be provided in addition a self addressed card for requesting the SAI must also accompany the prospectus unless the toll free telephone number is provided and 3 if a request for the SAI is received by the registrant the statement must be sent within one business day of receipt of the request and must be sent by first class mail or other means designed to ensure equally prompt delivery The statutory provisions relating to the dating of the prospectus apply equally to the dating of the SAI for purposes of Rule 423 under the Securities Act 17 CFR 230 423 Furthermore the SAI should be made available to investors as of the same time that the prospectus becomes available for purposes of Rule 430 under the Securities Act 17 CFR 230 430 G Incorporation by Reference and Delivery of Prospectuses or Reports Filed with the Commission If any\n",
